# Automated-Liver-Disease-Diagnosis-and-Prediction
Approximately 4.6 million people in USA are infected with Hepatitis C and almost 20,000 die each year before diagnosis. Developing new-disease prediction framework using support vector machine and k-nn algorithms with R to increase disease prediction in mass at a faster rate. The algorithm not only predicts detection at a better accuracy but also lowers the chances of missing patients suffering from disease by means of higher recall.
